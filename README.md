### What is this?

This a fork of the cloudgamestream GitHub thing avalible here: https://github.com/acceleration3/cloudgamestream

I will hopefully be able to modify the script so that Openstream can be used instead of Geforce Expirence. 

Openstream is here: https://github.com/LS3solutions/openstream-server

The script had many useful thing that it could install, so I'm just replacing the Geforce part of the installation. 

### What would this be useful for?

This would be useful for video/creative, obviously gaming, but also great for general remote desktoping in case your current computer is a bit low powered.
